Yes, it is just another CMS written in PHP.

But in comparison to other similar naive projects I've spent much time trying to do things right :) Project uses the MVC design and PHP object model. It's been a bit inspired by RoR and another frameworks. In the end there should be easily extend-able CMS (Content management system) with an advanced framework as its core.

For example we'll want to develop a simple blog with front-end and back-end interface. So we will only specify the data relationships and HTML design, the rest will be done by the system.

Project uses PHP 5 (object model), MySQL database (PostgreSQL and SQLite is planned), standard PHP libraries and some open-source third-party libraries (Smarty, TinyMCE, etc.)

Motto of the project: "Let's solve one problem only once."
