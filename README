Project WildBlog

Author: Honza Horak <horak.honza@gmail.com>

Description:
Just another CMS written in PHP. But in comparison to other similar naive 
projects I've spent much effort to do it right :) Project uses the MVC design 
and PHP object model (a bit inspired by RoR and another frameworks). 
The system should be easy to extend, debug and use.

The main aim of the project is to develop a CMS (Content management system) 
with an advanced framework as its core, which is possible to get to work 
within a couple of minutes. 

Project uses PHP (object model), MySQL database, standard PHP libraries 
and some open-source third-party libraries (Smarty, P.O.R.K, TinyMCE, etc.)
