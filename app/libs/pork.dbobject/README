Pork.dbObject
WTF is Pork.dbObject?

It's an Object-Relation mapper for PHP 5 that attempts to be easy, fast, 
lightweight, uses optimized database queries and provides an easy Find() 
function very loosely based on rails'. Also, i'm coming with Pork.Generator: 
A PHP5 based database analyzer that automatically sees the different types 
of relations in your (MySQL) database and creates linked dbObjects for it.
Rrright... And now in English?

In short, the O/R mapper handles all your basic Select/Insert/Update/Delete/Join 
statements for you so you won't have to write the same SQL over and over. 
You just create PHP objects that are linked to a row in the database.
